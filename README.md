## About

With the release of the 9th generation of Pokémon games, Pokémon: Scarlet & Violet, 107 new Pokémon have been introduced to the competitive scene. With so many new Pokémon to consider when choosing a team for competitive play, our analysis seeks to determine what traits Pokémon have that can lead to them being considered valuable for competitive play in order to forecast how the competitive scene will react to these new additions.

## Data

Data is sourced from kaggle: ["Complete Competitive Pokemon Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/n2cholas/competitive-pokemon-dataset?select=pokemon-data.csv) provided by Nicholas Vadivelu. The data set considers all Pokémon up to the 7th generation (Pokémon: Sun & Moon), as well as data for all moves in the games up to that point.

## Methods

This analysis is written in R and makes use of Random Forests and Generalized Linear Models to analyze the data.
